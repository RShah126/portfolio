<p id = "Bio"> 
    Welcome to my tech bio, my name is Ryan Shah, and currently I am a Corporate Relocations IT Technician at The Jace Solution. I like software development and IT, and I like combining the two into something called DevOps.
    Since a young age, I've been into computers and technology, and today I work with those interests. I'm also into biking, traveling, playing video games, and working out, and have traveled extensively throughout the US, and Europe. I enjoy learning new things in technology and constantly updating my knowledge.
